## 1. Introduction: Physics to Technology

### 1.1 The ACT Technology Pipeline

ACT isn't just theoretical—it enables **practical technologies** through:

1. **New materials** from network-inspired design
2. **Quantum devices** based on causal principles
3. **Energy sources** from spacetime engineering
4. **Computing paradigms** beyond classical limits

**Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)**:

| Technology | Current TRL | Target TRL | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Quantum gravity sensors | 2-3 | 7 | 2040 |
| Causal computing | 1-2 | 6 | 2035 |
| Dark energy batteries | 0-1 | 5 | 2050 |
| Spacetime engineering | 0 | 4 | 2060+ |

### 1.2 Fundamental Principles for Applications

**Key ACT principles with technological implications**:

1. **Causal structure engineering**: Manipulate spacetime connections
2. **Quantum network coherence**: Maintain quantum states in complex systems
3. **Topological memory**: Information storage in network defects
4. **Energy from vacuum**: Extract zero-point energy responsibly
